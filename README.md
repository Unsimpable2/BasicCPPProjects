# BasicCPPProjects
1. Search pairs of words in vector 
2. Edit text file - The program works from the command line (cmd). We first give the name of the program, 
a file with the extension .exe, after which we can enter the input arguments in a different 
order, but always after the appropriate argument should be depending on what we have 
provided, whether the file with the text on which the operations will be performed or the name 
of the file where it will be saved program result (at the end I will give some examples of 
correct commands for the program to work). Files on which the program will run should be in 
the same folder / location as the program itself. The program has safeguards in case of giving 
an incorrect argument or parameter (the list of parameters responsible for the operation can be 
found under the argument -h or after hanging the name of the pro-program with the extension 
.exe + how to handle the program). The messages are saved so that everyone understands 
what was wrong and what should change so that the program works properly. During some 
operations on the text, the program will ask the user to provide data necessary for the 
operation (parameters U and P). If the user provided appropriate arguments, filenames to 
check, etc., the program will show a message that it worked correctly, it means that 
everything has been done better and the result is waiting in the write peak that the user has 
given.
